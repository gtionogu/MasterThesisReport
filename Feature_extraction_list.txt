\paragraph{Time-based}
When we analyse many requests to a particular domain over
time, patterns indicative of malicious behaviour may emerge.\\
These were supposed to be the features with the most weight, unfortunately due to lack of the same caliber of capture available to the authors of Exposure, we could not test out the 4 features related to time. Either because the datasets are compositions of smaller datasets, or because the timestamps are too short.
\paragraph{DNS answer based}
Here are some domain-flux features: A domain name can map to multiple IP addresses. In such cases,the DNS server cycles through the different IP addresses in a round robin fashion and returns a different IP mapping each time. \\
Malicious domains typically resolve to compromised computers that reside in different locations. The attackers typically use domains that map to multiple IP addresses, and IPs might be shared across different domains.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item the number of different IP addresses that are resolved for a given domain during the experiment window
\item the number of different countries that these IP addresses are located in
\item the reverse DNS query results of the returned IP addresses
\item the number of distinct domains that share the IP addresses that resolve to the given domain (false positive can be reduced with google reverse DNS which will have hosting providers in top answers)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{TTL value based}
Low TTL and Round-Robin DNS: \\
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item high availability (Content Delivery Networks (CDNs))
\item botnets using this, makes them resistant to DNS Blacklists(DNSBL) and take downs. Often using Fast-Flux Service Networks (FFSN).
\end{itemize}
Because FFSN are usually detectable because of low TTL and growing list of distinct IP addresses for a domain, it explains the purpose of the TTL features.
\paragraph{Domain name based}
Finally 2 simple features to expect detection of DGA: there is a big difference between legit domain names and domains generated by DGAs(Domain Generation Algorithms(DGAs).\\
This can be noticed with 2 simple features:\\
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item ratio numerical chars to length of domain name
\item length of the longest meaningful substring to length of domain name
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
Numerous unique A records for a domain\\
\hline
Numerous unique NS records for a  domain\\
\hline
Different Autonomous Systems (ASN) for the IPs of linked to the same domain\\
\hline



\cite{ff1}
Some features for FF detection: 
nb of A records returned: 1-3 normal, 5 or more ff 
nb of NS: normal -> small, ff -> several NS
several A records for the NS AS: small nb of A from 1 AS -> normal,
located in different AS -> ff 
Hardware and IP: range of IP is diverged -> ff 
No physical agent -> ff 
no guarantee uptime -> ff

\cite{ff3}
\textbf{Fluxiness} is the total of unique A records for a domain divided by the number of A records returned for each lookup. This measures consistency in the unique A records returned. \\
\textbf{Flux-score} an hyperplane that separates benign from malicious fast flux where $ x = (n_A,n_{ASN},n_{NS})$ (unique A records, ASN and SN records) and the plane is defined as follows\\
%\begin{equation}
%F(x) = 
%\begin{cases}
%   w^Tx-b > 0  & \text{x is a FFSN}\\
%   w^Tx-b \leq 0 & \text{x is CDN}\\
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
From $F(x)$ they induce a metric $f(x) = w^Tx$ with w the weight of the vector and b a bias. $f(x) > b$ would mean x is a FFSN. By empirically testing this on a labelled dataset they determined the value of w and b. $w = (1.32,18.54,0)$ and $b =142.38$. We can notice that $n_{NS}$ does not have any impact.

Thomas et al. \cite{dga4} As the nature of the DGA is to create a large number of domains, yet the botmaster will only register a small subset of these domains, a large portion
of the DNS traffic will fall into the NXDomain (Non-Existent Domain) [14]. We observe that NXDomains have a limited caching characteristic, which make most of the queries concerning NXDomains propagate to the registry DNS servers. We hope to identify these domains and use that as a base of tracking the actively registered command and control domain in the YXDomain (Existent Domain), non-NXDomain typically resulting in NOERROR DNS.

SIMILAR IDEA \cite{phoenix}"These approaches are very interesting to detect infected clients over a large network over which the analyst has full control. However, they impose undesirable requirements in terms of input data and deployment to create a large-scale observatory and intelligence service.

BUT First, relying on the IP addresses of querying hosts is error prone, because of IP-(re)assignment and masquerading policies
employed by ASs. + BONUS: More importantly, access to this information is limited in scope, because it is available only from DNS servers placed below the recursive
DNS level (e.g., host DNSs). This can be problematic for researchers, but also for practitioners who want to operate these systems beyond the scope of a single network. Finally, of particular interest for researchers, IP information raises privacy concerns, leading to non-repeatable experiments [16], as datasets that include these details cannot be made publicly available."
